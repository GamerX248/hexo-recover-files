# Hexo-recover-files

Recover your markdown files from your static repository for your Hexo based site.

For those (like me) who were silly and did not back up their precompiled markdown files for their Hexo blog, hopefully this repo helps. The goal is to be able to clone your static repo with your compiled HTML files to  convert them back into markdown and the proper pre-compiled directory structure.

## Instructions

1. Clone your static repo here.

2. Rename your repo folder to `website`

3. Run `python extract.py`
